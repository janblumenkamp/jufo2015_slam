My project for Jugend Forscht 2015: Implementing a simple SLAM algorithm at our RoboCup Roboter with an enhanced hardware (STM32F4 ARM Controller) and FreeRTOS

In this repository you can find my attempt to implement the tinyslam SLAM algorithm (https://openslam.org/tinyslam.html).
As hardware platform I used our RoboCup robot (see rcj2015 repository) with an self built enhancement (STM32F4 Discovery and Neato XV-11 Lidar).
All the documentation can be found in the Docu/document.pdf file (this is the Jugend Forscht ("Youth Research") documentation, unfortunately only in german...
Maybe I will translate the most important parts sometime in the wiki.
